# MakeMeLaTeX
A simple and easy-to-use python code for LaTeX file template creating.

## Functioning

The concept of MakeMeLaTeX si simply to create a ".tex" file and to write in it the preamble of the document, 
basically :
- the packages that will be used
- the author
- the date
- the title

To choose which package will be written in the ".tex" document, the python code will ask questions to which the answer is y(es) or n(o), for instance to the question "Graphs, shemas ?", if the answer is "y", then the package "tikz" will be added, if the answer is "no", the package will not be added.

The questions can be removed from the Python code or some questions can be added as well.
